# the-game-of-pig

Hey, so this is a two-player game I made where a user can accumulate any number of dice rolls total until he/she is satisfied to keep the score and pass the dice to the second player. But here's the catch - if one stretches their luck too far, the dice would roll and one and all the accumulations will be gone for that single round of the respective player and will end up with 0 points added to his overall score.

This might seem very simple on the surface, however coding this entire project with vanilla JS was a handsome learning experience for sure, especially the DOM manipulation part!

Agree on a winning score, and let's begin - https://rahulsomaliya.github.io/the-game-of-pig/
